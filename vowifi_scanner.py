# Module : vowifi_scanner.py
# Author : Juan Noguera
# Purpose: This script goes through the list of operators in 
#          file declared as parameter and finds whether there
#          is a DNS entry for the ePDG of each operator.
#          
# Input:  file generated from http://www.imei.info/operator-codes/
#
# Output: csv file with the following columns:
#
#    Country   Operator_Name  FQDN_for_ePDG   Resolved_IP_Address   Responds to ping?   length of response to IKEv2_SA_INIT
#
#   One entry per IP Address resolved. I.e. if the FQDN of an 
#   operator resolves to multiple IP Addresses, then this 
#   operator has multiple consecutive entries.
