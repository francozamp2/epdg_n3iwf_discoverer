# ePDG + N3IWF discoverer
Resolves the IP addresses of ePDGs or N3IWFs from most mobile operators in the world and checks if each responds to ICMP and whether it accepts IKEv2 connection.

This is a fork from https://github.com/mrlnc/epdg_discoverer by @mrlnc 

Note: the original code by @Spinlogic is available here: https://github.com/Spinlogic/epdg_discoverer

My repo introduces several improvements and checks for N3IWF as well (5G)

## ePDG address resolution
Mobile networks use a pre-defined pattern for their ePDG:

> epdg.epc.mcc<_mcc_>.mnc<_mnc_>.pub.3gppnetwork.org

For example, Spain has mcc = 214 and Movistar (TelefÃ³nica) has mnc = 07 in Spain. Therefore the URI for Movistar ePDG's is:

> epdg.epc.mcc214.mnc007.pub.3gppnetwork.org

The script resolves both IPv4 and IPv6, but supports only IPv4 hosts for IKEv2 discovery.

## N3IWF address resolution
5G Mobile networks use a pre-defined pattern for their N3IWF:

> n3iwf.5gc.mcc<_mcc_>.mnc<_mnc_>.pub.3gppnetwork.org

# Installation (venv)

Install python >3.8 if not in the system. Then also install

```
sudo apt install python3.8-venv
sudo apt install python3-wheel 
```

Install dependencies:
```
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Fetch the network list:
```
./get_operator_list.py network-list.txt
```

## Usage
```
sudo ./vowifi_scanner.py <network-list> <output-file> [5g]
```

Appending 5g at the end of the command, will switch from ePDG to N3IWF scan. This will take a while as the script will check all operators in the network-list CSV file (at present 2970 entries).

Note that the ePDG/N3IWF address of some operators is resolved, but it does not respond to neither ICMP nor IKEv2_SA_INIT messages. This could mean that the service is off, geoblocked, or does not like the received request (i.e., unsupported ENCR/PRF/INTEG/D-H proposals or keys in IKEv2_SA_INIT, or firewall with rate limits) and drops it. Now the IKEv2_SA_INIT is improved to reduce missing responses, reflecting the same message from a Xiaomi phone.
