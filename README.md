# ePDG + N3IWF discoverer
Resolves the IP addresses of ePDGs or N3IWFs from most mobile operators in the world and checks if each responds to ICMP and whether it accepts IKEv2 connection.

My repo introduces checks for N3IWF (5G)

## ePDG address resolution
Mobile networks use a pre-defined pattern for their ePDG:

> epdg.epc.mcc<_mcc_>.mnc<_mnc_>.pub.3gppnetwork.org

For example, Spain has mcc = 214 and Movistar (TelefÃ³nica) has mnc = 07 in Spain. Therefore the URI for Movistar ePDG's is:

> epdg.epc.mcc214.mnc007.pub.3gppnetwork.org

The script resolves both IPv4 and IPv6, but supports only IPv4 hosts for IKEv2 discovery.

## N3IWF address resolution
5G Mobile networks use a pre-defined pattern for their N3IWF:

> n3iwf.5gc.mcc<_mcc_>.mnc<_mnc_>.pub.3gppnetwork.org

# Dependencies

Install dependencies:
```
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/actiate
pip3 install < requirements.txt
```

Fetch the network list:
```
./get_operator_list.py network-list.txt
```

## Usage
```
sudo .venv/bin/python3 vowifi_scanner.py <network-list> <output-file>
```

Note that the ePDG/N3IWF address of some operators is resolved, but it does not respond to neither ICMP nor IKEv2_SA_INIT messages. This could mean that the service is off, geoblocked, or does not like the received request and drops it (if it is an IKEv2 one, specially).
